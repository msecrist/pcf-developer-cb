== General Overview

This course was designed to be strictly about Pivotal Cloud Foundry®, and attempts as
much as possible not to delve into any coding activities.
There are some topics where it's unavoidable, but even there, you'll see that the
labs provide the code for the student, often even in pre-compiled fashion, and the
extent of 'coding' doesn't go beyond reading and analyzing the source code.

_Please make clear to students that this course is about deploying applications to
PCF, not writing those applications._

The goal is to learn PCF from the point of view of the developer, who will need to
know how to deploy applications to PCF.  Administration topics such as installation,
upgrades, bosh, etc.. are not not core to this narrative, and not included.
The one administrative feature discussed is Application Security Groups, as in this
particular case, it is pertinent for a developer to know about this feature.  There is
an optional section on installation, mostly as background for Service Tiles.

*Note:* There are a number of _TODO_ paragraphs in this document.  They are intended
as a note to Pivotal to revisit some of the material.  You can safely ignore them.

== Duration

This course is designed to be delivered over a period of three days at a leisurely pace.
There is plenty of time in the course for students to read through some of the user
guide references pointed to from the labs, and for an instructor to discuss and teach
particular features of PCF which are not specifically covered in the presentation slides.

On any day, if you have covered the material for that day by 4:00 PM or later, you can
choose to stop for the day.  Alternatively, by pressing on, you can finish early on day
3. This leaves time for extra material, or to allow students who need to get transport
to leave in good time.


=== Daily Breakdown

==== Day 1

Suggested topics to cover on day 1:

* An introduction to Pivotal Cloud Foundry®®
* Concepts
* Getting Started with `cf` CLI (also includes App Manager)
* Logging, Scale and HA
* Installation Overview (optional, allows you to discuss Service Tiles)
** Notes at _back_ of student handout PDF
* Services

What stands out about day one is that some time has to be allotted for attendees to
bootstrap into the course:  there's the general course intro and logistical information,
introductions, and then there's setting up the student environment, which primarily
entails setting up a Cloud Foundry® account.

The `cf` CLI installation and `cf login` steps are described as part of the first lab - but
we recommend you get the class to do it as part of the "Getting Started" section (see
below).

Depending on the experience level of the class, you may finish day 1 a little early.

==== Day 2

Topics:

* Manifest and Env Vars
* Application Security Groups
* Log Drain
* Blue-Green
* Microservices
* Application Autoscaler
* Application Performance Monitor
* Metrics

I typically finish a little early, perhaps around 4:00 PM on day 2.

==== Day 3

Topics:

* Buildpack
* Service Broker
* Continuous Delivery
* Route Service
* Advanced Topics

Buildpack and Service Broker labs tend to go together:  they both speak to means of
extending the platform.  There's no particular reason that route services has to be at
the end.  I personally would prefer to see it grouped with other service-related topics:
services, and log-draining.  They all have in common the `create-user-provided-service`
command, just using a different flag:  `-p`, `-l`, and `-r`.

The continuous delivery topic is sort of part 2 to the microservices talk.  I
personally like the fact that the two talks are spread out, each on a separate day.

I often finish day 3 around 4:00 PM as well.

== Setup

The main concern here is providing students with a PCF account.  In order of ease of
setup:

. If teaching a course for a specific PCF customer, they may wish to do the course
  on their PCF Installation.  They will need to make sure they have accounts setup
  before the course commences.
. Otherwise, use Pivotal Web Services.  Students setup a free-trial account, and that
  works fine.
. Sometimes we encounter situations where a student has, in the past, already created a
  PWS account, but their free trial has expired.  They can still log in, but are
  prompted for payment information.  In these situations, instructors can setup
  a space for the student in question in the Pivotal-Education-Students organization
  in PWS.  If you do not have access to this organization, contact Pivotal Education.
. Another work around is to get the student to register a new PWS account. They will
  need a new email (not normally a problem) and they will need a different phone number
  for SMS validation.  In most cases they should be able to use a friend's or
  relative's phone.
. Technically an instructor could stand up a PCF instance in AWS or GCP or elsewhere,
  and create accounts for each student.  I've done that before.  But for the majority
  of deliveries, it is not required
  +
  The instructor materials include the `create-pes-spaces.sh` shell script that automates the
  creation of a space for a student.  There is also `delete-pes-spaces.sh` (cleanup script)
  for cleaning up the space (and removing the user from the org) after class is over.

Additional setup is required for the jenkins and service broker labs.  These are
explained respectively in each of these modules' notes below.

== Modules

=== Module: An Introduction to Cloud Foundry®

The presentation here is designed to be a very high level overview, and attempts to
explain the motivation for a PaaS.  Somewhere in this presentation we introduce Onsi's
famous https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku[Haiku] (Japanese short poem) that explains the
philosophy of a PaaS: https://content.pivotal.io/social/pivotal-2172. It reads:

[verse, Onsi Fakhouri, Pivotal]
Here is my source code,
run it on the cloud for me.
I do not care how

Thee is no lab.  It has moved to the Getting Sta
=== Concepts ===

Cloud Foundry® uses many terms in a specific way and this section covers them all in
one go.  Most of them are not that complex, although organization and space do have
a very specific meaning in PCF.

This should be a short section to introduce the terms. They are all listed on the 
last (summary) slide, so you can go around the room and see if they remember what
you just taught.

=== Getting Started

This is a module from the old DAwCF course and it is designed to be interactive.

As you go through discussing some common `cf` commands, the students get to run them
and answer questions.

This means you need to get the students setup on PCF/PWS and have `cf` installed.  It
is actually easier to do these two activities as a class session rather than having
to go around the room during the first lab explaining the same things over and over.

The lab instructions do describe the necessary bootstrapping if they need
additional help:

- Downloading the `cf` CLI
- Logging in to the Cloud Foundry® account


Once you get to `cf push`, it ceases to be interactive.  They will do `cf push` in the
first lab.

In the lab we start with deploying four different 'hello world' style applications, to
make the point that PCF is a polyglot platform.

Students learn a lot of the basics very quickly, and start asking themselves all the
right questions to begin to gain a deeper understanding of PCF: what happens during a
push.  It is inevitable that the conversation will lead in this direction, which
leads nicely into the next module.

NOTE: The types of mistakes I've seen students make is to attempt to push an application
without first changing to the directory that contains the code in question.  *It's not
a bad idea to let students know before the lab begins:  by default what gets uploaded
are the entire contents of the current working directory!*  Another item I stress is
that the first argument to `cf push` is the application name, _not_ a reference to a file
or artifact that is to be uploaded.

During the subsequent review, I like to point out that, for Java applications, you must
pass in the path (-p) flag to the push command (it is also worth mentioning this when
going through the _Spring Music_ example in the slides).  In the review I also make
it a point to cover what happens with respect to the setup of a route for an application,
which is an opportunity to explain the `random-route` flag.  I also like to point out that
just overriding the host attribute, `-n`, is often sufficient.

I also like, in a review, to cover other basic `cf` commands that the students were
exposed to:  `apps`, `app`, `stop`, `start`, `restart`, etc..


=== Module: Logging, Scale and HA

The presentation here is difficult, because the instructor needs to explain a great
deal about the internal architecture of Cloud Foundry®, perhaps a little too early in
the course.

TODO: Consider moving some aspects of this module to later in the course.
   The DAwCF course used to do this nicely and delve into the architecture at the end.

I like to try to draw a diagram of the Cloud Foundry® architecture as I describe each
of the components.  Sometimes, to explain auctions, I'll demo a few minutes' of Onsi's
presentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OkmVTFhfLY[Re-envisioning the elastic runtime^]
(from 14:00 to 16:30, roughly).

This presentation is long, and will often spill into the afternoon.

When I discuss the Cloud Controller and the Cloud Foundry® API, I like to remind them
how to see the http requests and responses by using `cf -v ...` or by setting
`CF_TRACE=true`. Showing `CF_TRACE=/some/file/path` is also useful as support often
ask customers to send them a trace file.

The lab is a refreshing change of pace; it's also a natural progression from the
previous lab, learning some new `cf` commands: `cf logs`, `cf events`, `cf scale`.

It ties into the High Availability portion of the presentation by having the students
kill their app and see it restart.  I like to use the command line "watch" utility
to auto-refresh the status of an app so I can "see" a container get restarted
(`watch cf app <appname>`).

 * Linux: `watch` is a standard utility
 * MacOS: Install using `brew install watch`
 * Windows: Not available (unless you have Cygwin), but you can get a similar result
    with Powershell by running : `while ($true -eq $true) {cf app <appname>; sleep 2}`

In all cases use CTRL-C to stop watching.

In the review, I look for opportunities to show students things that perhaps were not
covered.  I like to show them `cf ssh`, for example (although this does come up later).

=== OPTIONAL Module: Installation Guide

This is useful for two reasons.  You often get Admins on this course anyway, so you can
at least give them a taste of what setting up PCF entails.

Secondly, it can be hard to discuss where services come from, if they don't know
what a Tile is.

The slides for this presentation are at the very end of their handout PDF.

=== Module: Services

The presentation deck here is much less brief than before.  Explains the idea of
services and distinction between managed and user-provided services.  I often like to
make reference to how one used to manually obtain database credentials, for example.

I also like to state how, although the main purpose for Cloud Foundry® is to push
apps, it doesn't stop there:  managed services automate the provisioning of backing
resources for developers.

The lab here is rather well done:  it provides the context for a student to experiment
with both types of services:  a user-provided service and a managed service.
The crux of the lab is for the student to understand
 * what a `create-user-provided-service -p` invocation does
 ** that it's interactive, and
 ** specifying the right value for the uri
 * not to use https (because the client is not setup to make ssl calls,
 * and to adhere to the contract setup by the author of the feature
 ** to specify the uri with the attendees/ suffix.

TODO: Personally I'd rather the client add the suffix if it's missing (i.e. allow
      entry of the base url).

I've seen some oddities in the behavior of `articulate` here, where sometimes the
list of attendees will properly appear on the page, but refreshing the page might
result in an empty view.  TODO: investigate this.


=== Module: Manifest

Once more, this lab is a perfect follow-on to the previous one:  now that we've had the
exposure to using `cf push` and learned many of its flags, let's hide them away into a
manifest file.

This module now has a presentation!  The idea was to put the onus on the students to
learn the feature by reading the docs. However students were never happy with this
approach.

About the lab, I personally wish students were made to write a manifest from scratch.
Instead they're instructed to invoke a command that will write it for them, which I
think is a shame.  I rarely see students write their own manifests in subsequent labs,
and I suspect it's because they weren't tasked enough in this lab.  On the other hand
some of them are likely to get them wrong, auto-generation avoids that.

TODO: revise the lab accordingly?

One advantage of manifests is the ability to bind a service during start-up.
Without a manifest students must perform three steps:
  * `cf push --no-start ...`
  * `bind-service ...`
  * `cf start`
  
During review, suggest to the students that in subsequent labs, the completion of
the lab can be simpler if they opt to generate a manifest and modify it to add the
service(s) they need, instead of following the instructions verbatim.

TODO: consider re-writing subsequent labs to require the student to write the manifest,
especially where services are involved, to avoid that three step startup procedure.


=== Module: Application Security Groups

The major obstacle in this lab is that ASGs cannot be configured unless one is an
administrator.  I mitigate this problem by demonstrating the lab in a group setting over
the projector, by using a separate PCF instance that I stood up for such occasions.

Summary of the demo:
 * push attendee-service with backing service mysql
 * ask the class:  why does this work?  there must be an ASG that allows the app to talk to mysql
 * task: find the ASG in question:  `cf security-groups` and `cf running-security-groups` should show the default_security_group
 * task: remove default_security_group from the running set and restart the app, to demonstrate that it can't connect to the database any longer
 * task: create a custom asg for mysql (hint: lookup ip and port from VCAP_SERVICES)
 * task: bind custom asg to the org in question, restart the app, and demonstrate the app is working once more

The point to get across is that even if developers can't setup ASGs, they need to know
they exist so that when they have problems, they know what to ask their administrators
to fix.

=== Module: Log Drain

The presentation here is very brief, just a review of parts of the presentation from
the _Logging, Scale and HA_ module.  Review "treat logs as a stream" from the 12
factors, how the loggregator works.  I make analogy to plumbing and pipes.
Tapping into doppler to forward application logs to a third party service.

This lab is often completed very quickly: there's not much to do to make this work.
And that's partly the point: that it's easy to add capabilities or support to
an application that's running in PCF.

Often students will be aware of the potential security issue of sending logs to
a third party, and so perhaps point out that this same mechanism can be used
to send logs to an internally deployed log analysis tool.  Splunk for example is
often run in-house.


=== Module: Blue-Green

The presentation here has two parts:  blue-green deployments, and a discussion
of other concerns when upgrading an application, such as database migrations,
and gotchas having to do with Java serialization and class evolution.  I try
to focus on the former.

The lab is pretty cool, with the visualization of percent of traffic that
flows to each of two applications.  It's a little contrived in the sense that
the same artifact is deployed each time.

TODO: consider how to improve this.
TODO: explore using names aritculate-blue and articulate-green instead of
       articulate and articulate-temp (personal preference).


=== Module: Microservices

Presentation only.  It's essential to point out that a platform can only go so far.

In tandem, we must design our applications to run well in the cloud: to be cloud native.

Also managing a microservices system involves keeping many, many processes runnging.
The system involves multiple microservices, plus helper processes (like service
registration) and multiple instances of each for load-sharing and redundancy.

A PaaS makes this so much easier to do. Good opportunity to do a quick quiz on the
4 levels of HA in PCF.


=== Module: Application Autoscaler

This is a fun lab.  Using  `JMeter` to exercise a load against an application is
always fun, and seeing an application auto-scale.

One difficulty here is maintaining a high cpu for over 30 seconds, especially when the
endpoint just returns data.  I usually can make it work for myself.  Increase the number
of `JMeter` threads or lower the cpu threshold, or try to hit a different endpoint.

If you encounter such difficulty, consider manually scaling up the application to
five instances, then to turn on the autoscaler and watch it scale down your application.


=== Module: Application Performance Monitor

Here we use New Relic®.

Stress that the students should use the managed service in the PWS marketplace
(assuming you're using PWS), and that the integration with New Relic® transparently
takes care of the "account-setup" negotiation between PWS and New Relic® (i.e.
there's no need to create a New Relic® account).

When you click on the "Manage" link for New Relic®, you're taken directly to the
New Relic® dashboard.  I've run into an issue where a previous manual login into a
pre-existing New Relic® account will prevent this from working properly.
The remedy is to explicitly logout of the New Relic® web-site, and/or to look for
and delete cookies associated with the `newrelic.com` domain.

Finally, it's important to stress in this lab how the integration with New Relic®
actually works.  Typically one would have to manually bundle the New Relic® agent
jar file with their app.  Here we see the buildpack doing this for us transparently:
that's essentially why we need to restage the application for the integration to work
(because the buildpack downloads and includes the New Relic® agent jar file into
the newly-created droplet).


=== Module: Metrics

This lab is very short and sparse.  Again it puts the onus on the student to
take the time to read about PCF metrics and to perform _ad hoc_ experimentation with
the tool.

TODO: consider ways to expand or re-cast the lab with specific activities and goals.

I've often ended the day early at this point (~ 3:30 PM - 4:00 PM) and reserved
the remaining topics for day 3. However the extra material we've added to Day 1
should help overcome this.

=== Module: Buildpack

The presentation here is much expanded from before..  I usually like to complement
the existing materials (presentation and lab) with the following discussions and
demonstrations:

- Discuss the variety of buildpacks that exist: the built-in ones, the community
  buildpacks.  i like to demonstrate the staticfile buildpack as an example.

- Demonstrate running the Java buildpack's detect, compile, and release scripts locally.

- Demonstrate additional features of the Java buildpack.  I like to point out
  https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/products/new-cloud-foundry-java-buildpack-improves-developer-diagnostic-tools[Ben Hale's blog entry^]
  and show how to put a breakpoint in an app and remote-debug a Cloud Foundry®
  application by setting up an ssh tunnel.

- Show the administrative side of buildpacks:  how an admin might ugprade a
  buildpack with the delete-buildpack and create-buildpack commands (or update-buildpack).
  I use a personally deployed instance of PCF for this, as it requires admin rights.


=== Module: Service Broker

The presentation here is straightforward.  I like to pull up the service broker api
documentation online and show students where they can get to the docs.

For the lab here we provision a VM instance in AWS in advance.  Use the `mongo.tf`
terraform script in the student files (e-learning students have to do this for
themselves).  The output of the script will be the public IP address of the VM, which
needs to be communicated to the students (they set an environment variable
named `MONGODB_HOST`).  They will also need a password (`MONGODB_PASSWORD`). The
setup instructions show you where to find it).

I like to review the lab in two parts:

. Explain the mechanics of pushing the app, viewing the `/v2/catalog` endpoint,
  registering the service broker, and otherwise making things work
. Explain the code that impelments what the service broker does (creating databases, users)

I also like to ask students to create a custom album in `spring-music` and `ssh` into
the Mongo VM, and find that record for them, as a sort of validation that the data is
indeed being persisted in their own db.

This also gives me the chance to talk about and explain the `--guid` flag in many of the
`cf` commands.


=== Module: Continuous Delivery

With respect to the lab, students here have two options:  they can run a jenkins instance
locally on their machine (the hard way), or use a jenkins instance that's already
provisioned for them.  In my experience, the latter option is a lot simpler and goes a
whole lot smoother.  So encourage students to use your aws-provisioned instance of jenkins.
Again there is a terraform script `jenkins.tf` in the student lab files.

A `jenkins.war` is in the Student Files for this course on Files Anywhere, but not in the
labs-zip due its size.  Downloading from Jenkins web-site is very slow.

For the presentation, I often go beyond what the slides offer.

This lab consumes a lot of time and is much more about learning Jenkins that CD.
You may not feel it is worth the time to do it.

TODO: retrofit the slide deck to include additional information:  pictures of teams
working in an agile fashion, radiators on dev floors, a screenshot of a build pipeline,
Mike Cohn's test pyramid,  etc..

=== Module: Route Service

This module targets a distinct feature of Cloud Foundry® and works well.  Students
often have difficulty with the basics:  they often will fail to run a `cf help` on a
new command before invoking it, or are confused by the syntax of a command, that one
must specify the domain name and hostname separately.  They often also struggle with
taking an example instruction and revising it correctly so that it uses their
application's hostname, for example.

=== Module: Advanced Topics

A few new features since 1.7 (the last release of this course).  Brief discussion, but there
is a lab on Tasks afterwards.  Unfortunately the students need maven for this one part of
the course - it is provided as a zip in the student files.
